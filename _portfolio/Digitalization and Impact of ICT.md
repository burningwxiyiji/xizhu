This series of studies concentrated on the inequity of the impact of ICT on different conditions. I have condensed some of my experiences in my CV and I will cover them in detail on this page.

## Regional Differences in the Impact of Digital Information Valuation on Urban and Rural Income Equity

Using cross-sectional data from the 2020 China Family Panel Studies (N=7,140), I applied a three-way interaction model in Stata to analyze how digital information usage and valuation affect income. The study shows that:

Digital information valuation positively correlates with income.

Urban–rural context negatively moderates this relationship.

Geographical location further differentiates the moderating effect.

A spatial visualization illustrates the regional disparities in digital dividends.

## Characteristics of Platform Workers

I conducted two analyses (N=1,354, N=1,500) on various digital labor groups in China—from DIDI drivers and couriers to IT workers—using R for descriptive analysis. The study reveals structural differences in income, gender, and working conditions.

## TikTok User Practices and Production

As part of a national social science project, I helped design interviews with both content creators and general users, and later interviewed new media departments within platform companies. The study investigates the cultural production logic of short video platforms.


## Research on Home Service Platform Companies in Shanghai

In a Shanghai government-funded project, I supported data collection through roundtables, interviews, and policy analysis.
