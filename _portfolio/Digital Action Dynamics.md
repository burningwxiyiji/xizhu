## The Self in Action: Reconfiguring the Unit of Online Social Action

Summary: This paper analyzes the characteristics of the Internet and its formative impact on the self within the context of social action and technological assemblage. It argues that in certain Internet activities, the reflexive self—traditionally grounded in spatiotemporal continuity-is—is supplanted by a horizontal arrangement of symbols. This shift results in a cognitive deficit, as actions are unable to reference the individual’s identity

Here is a very brief diagram of the online self, which is inspired by Brubaker：

## The Relationship Between Swarms and the Self in the Digital Age

Summary: Returning to the commonsense meaning of the self, this paper argues that social media has enabled a deviation between action and the formation of identity. In digital action, the degree of self-integration of actors takes on an indeterminate character, which in turn explains the form of online collective action.


## Unveiling the Dynamics of Digital Action: Exploring Text Accumulation

Summary: This study is an attempt to formalize my previous theoretical exploration of the self. It introduces Text Accumulation as a mechanism for online actor engagement. It characterizes the dissemination of information across public internet platforms and its influence on actors' actions.

We use Agent-Based Modeling for bridge the individual's action and its macro consequence：
