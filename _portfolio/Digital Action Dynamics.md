|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Behaviour**     | Psychology / Social Psychology           | Emphasizes emotional and immediate responses                | Crowd behavior theory, emotional contagion models     |

## Unveiling the Dynamics of Digital Action: Exploring Text Accumulation

Summary: This study attempts to formalize my theoretical exploration of the self. It introduces Text Accumulation as a mechanism for online actor engagement. We use Agent-Based Modeling to bridge the individual's action and its macro consequence：
