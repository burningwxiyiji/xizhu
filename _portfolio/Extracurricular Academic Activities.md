## The Xinshilin Academic Salon

Xinshilin is an interdisciplinary academic organization primarily involving philosophy, history, and sociology. It regularly hosts academic lectures organized by students. During my time at the school, I [served as a host](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/i20AQXeGvd9Cs2AsdXI5rA) and [poster designer](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1X1-9aOa6m-rDfqkzxD-qQ), and also [delivered lectures](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_2HwwR-RKzrP0nFCoY2tEA).
