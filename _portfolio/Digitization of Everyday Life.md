This series of studies shows my initial concern.

## The Digital Transformation of Interpersonal Relationships in Rural Areas

As the project lead, I secured a 10,000 RMB grant from Hunan Province (Item No. S202010530040). I designed a mixed-methods study and conducted month-long fieldwork in multiple rural villages. The research began with participatory observation and unstructured interviews, followed by a questionnaire for descriptive analysis.


## Local Practice and Organizational Logic of Digitalization of Grassroots Governance

This study examined how digital technologies are embedded in grassroots governance, particularly in areas reliant on local knowledge. During the pandemic, the implementation of the health code illustrated how technical systems restructure social processes. I compared regions where the system was abandoned post-lockdown with urban areas like Shanghai, where it became part of the healthcare infrastructure. 

I also conducted fieldwork on waste classification in Zhejiang, analyzing how high-precision policy demands are sustained through digital systems. [Read report(in Chinese)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20052348/default.pdf)
