**Rethinking the Relationship Between the Individual and the Collective on Social Media**

**Xizhuzeng**

Under reviewed by Exploration and Free Views(in Chinese) 

• Summary: Returning to the commonsense meaning of the self, this paper argues that social media has enabled a deviation between action and the formation of identity. In digital action, the degree of self-integration of actors takes on an indeterminate character, which in turn explains the form of online collective action.

**Xizhuzeng**

Presented at The 9th Lilin Forum, Beijing, 2023.10.15 

• Summary: This paper analyzes the characteristics of the Internet and its formative impact on the self within the context of social action and technological assemblage.
