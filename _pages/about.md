☀️ Hello, welcome to my page!

I'm a master's student in sociology at [East China University of Science and Technology](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/), with research interests in digital sociology, political communication, and computational social science.


Research Interests
======
*polarization, online hostility, sociology of knowledge*

My work explores how hostile speech and collective emotions on social media shape public knowledge, particularly around gender and identity politics. I treat online text as both discourse and action, examining how it drives polarization, forges group identities, and influences social norms.


Current Projects
======

**1. Dynamics of Digital Action: A Theoretical and Computational Approach**
This project develops a framework explaining the fragmentation of online self and action. I co-designed the theoretical model, conducted the literature review, and contributed to ABM simulations.
This work can be referenced in the [draft](files/writing sample.pdf).
→ Early theoretical work was presented at the 9th Lilin Forum (CASS)

**2. Digital Vigilantism in China**
Combining digital nationalism and digital activism literature, this project investigates belief shifts in online campaigns. I led literature reviews, coordinated RA recruitment, and built a public dataset.

**3. Trolls and Polarization: Gender Antagonism on Chinese Social Media**
A mixed-method study of gender conflict online, using text mining and clustering to identify divergent discursive strategies. I conducted scraping, labeling, and early-stage network analysis.


Academic Journey
======

I began with STS-based fieldwork on digital governance, later turning to digital activism and computational approaches. I aim to bridge micro-level interaction with macro-level effects using theory-driven research.

Methods
------

Quantitative: survey design, correlational stats, ANOVA, factor analysis

Qualitative: fieldwork, interviews, participatory observation, unstructured coding

Computational: R (tidyverse, lavaan, ggplot2), Python (pandas), ABM, basic social network analysis

Platforms: Qualtrics, Git, Google Colab, [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/), [panda documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), freecodecamp
