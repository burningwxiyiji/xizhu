☀️ Hello, welcome to my page!

I'm currently a Master's student in Sociology at [East China University of Science and Technology](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/), and an incoming MA student in [Communication Studies at UT Austin](https://commstudies.utexas.edu/). My core research interests lie at the intersection of digital sociology, political communication, and computational social science.

I've deferred my admission to UT Austin due to a funding issue. I'm actively using this time to develop my machine learning skills, with the goal of securing a Research Assistant (RA) position with my First Semester Mentor. My academic journey has been strategically shifting towards these computational and communication areas over the past two years, complemented by my theoretical work in digital sociology, which was presented at [the highest-level Chinese Youth Sociologist Forum(Li Lin Forum)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kBLveoJwuFgBhBEmFrOMxQ).

My primary focus is on online identity and behavior. Feel free to contact me if you share interests in human behavior on social media or related interdisciplinary research.


Research Interests
======
*polarization, online hostility, sociology of knowledge*

My work explores how hostile speech and collective emotions on social media shape public knowledge, particularly around gender and identity politics. I treat online text as both discourse and action, examining how it drives polarization, forges group identities, and influences social norms.


Current Projects
======

**1. Text Accumulation: Conceptualizing and Measuring Collective Attributes on Social Media**
We argue that classical political communication topics involving polarization, uncivil behaviors, and online radicalization on social media all demonstrate a collective attribute.
This attribute can be conceptualized by Text Accumulation and be measured by the scale and homogeneity of text. This paper unravels the comparability between online opinion dynamics and offline crowd behavior and reasserts that self-awareness is from a social role perspective. Social role, maintaining consistency based on social cues and feedback, differentiates from social identity or group norms. We proposed a self-integration mechanism and an algorithmic impact
mechanism to build an interpretation model of Text Accumulation and use Agent-Based Modeling to verify their impact on the fluctuations of texts. This general model of online behaviors can help us to understand the difference between opinion leaders and normal participation online and interpret why we observe different impacts of social media on polarization and uncivil behavior in different discussion areas.
This work can be referenced in the [draft](files/writing sample.pdf). 


**2. Self-Awareness, Consistency, and Political Action in Online Discourse**
Traditional political communication scholarship often attributes online polarization and collective action to factors like deindividuation (Suler, 2004) and strong group identity formation (Spears & Postmes, 2015). While these theories offer valuable insights, they may oversimplify the intricate cognitive processes of individual digital actors. 
This paper argues that an individual's self-awareness about their online political expressions is a critical, overlooked factor influencing speaking consistency and 'low commitment' online political action. We explore this as a complementary explanation to identity-based theories.
A 2 × 2 between-subjects online experiment will be conducted to examine the interaction between induced self-retrospection and participant behavior.


**3. Victim Narratives, Toxic Discourse: The Dynamics of Hate Speech in Online Incels Communities**
We argue that this narrative-based victimhood, stemming from shared experience and cognitive biases, powerfully motivates the production of hate speech. This study unpacks the dynamic interplay between this identity formation and online toxicity, offering a novel contribution to group identity theory.
Employ Perspective API to measure the toxicity levels of individual posts and replies, and to categorize specific types of hate speech present. Quantify the percentage and evolution of toxic content over time, providing both aggregate and user-level metrics.
We propose constructing a social-semantic multilayer network (Mohr, Wagner-Pacifici, & Breiger, 2015) to capture both the relational and discursive dimensions of online communities. By utilizing dynamic network models (ERGM/SAOM) with longitudinal data, we aim to uncover the intricate, evolving relationship between this identity construction and the proliferation of hate speech, providing critical empirical and theoretical insights into online radicalization.


Academic Journey
======

My academic journey began with a solid theoretical foundation in sociology during my undergraduate studies. I began with STS-based fieldwork on digital governance, later turning to social media and online behavior. 

Now, my research explores the dynamics of online text, viewing it as both information and action.
