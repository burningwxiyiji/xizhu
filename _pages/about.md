☀️ Hello, welcome to my page!

I am currently a Project Manager in the tech industry, with a background in Sociology (M.A.) from East China University of Science and Technology, where I was advised by Professor Wansheng Xiong. My academic training and ongoing interests lie in digital sociology and political communication. 

Previously, I was admitted to the M.A. program in Communication Studies at UT Austin, with a focus on computational and political communication. I rejected the admission due to funding considerations, but I continue to develop skills in machine learning, data analysis, and computational methods.

I remain active in interdisciplinary research related to online dynamics of publics. Before entering the industry, I conducted research on micro-foundations of online action. This work was presented at the Li Lin Forum, one of the most recognized platforms for early-career sociologists in China. 


Research Interests
======
*polarization, online hostility, sociology of knowledge*

My core concern in this domain is how everyday online behaviors have the potential to become politically significant. To trace this transformation, my research examines the actors, expressive forms, and consequences of communication within algorithmic environments.


Current Projects
======

**1. Self-Awareness, Consistency, and Political Action in Online Discourse**

Traditional political communication scholarship often attributes online polarization and collective action to factors like deindividuation (Suler, 2004) and strong group identity formation (Spears & Postmes, 2015). While these theories offer valuable insights, they may oversimplify the intricate cognitive processes of individual digital actors. 
This paper argues that an individual's self-awareness about their online political expressions is a critical, overlooked factor influencing speaking consistency and 'low commitment' online political action. We explore this as a complementary explanation to identity-based theories.
A 2 × 2 between-subjects online experiment will be conducted to examine the interaction between induced self-retrospection and participant behavior.


**2. Constructed Victimhood and Community Toxicity: The Dynamics of Hate Speech in Online Incels Communities**

We argue that this narrative-based victimhood, stemming from shared experience and cognitive biases, powerfully motivates the production of hate speech. This study unpacks the dynamic interplay between this identity formation and online toxicity, offering a novel contribution to group identity theory.
Employ Perspective API to measure the toxicity levels of individual posts and replies, and to categorize specific types of hate speech present. Quantify the percentage and evolution of toxic content over time, providing both aggregate and user-level metrics.
We propose constructing a social-semantic multilayer network (Mohr, Wagner-Pacifici, & Breiger, 2015) to capture both the relational and discursive dimensions of online communities. By utilizing dynamic network models (ERGM/SAOM) with longitudinal data, we aim to uncover the intricate, evolving relationship between this identity construction and the proliferation of hate speech, providing critical empirical and theoretical insights into online radicalization.


Academic Journey
======

My academic journey began with a solid theoretical foundation in sociology during my undergraduate studies. I began with STS-based fieldwork on digital governance, later turning to social media and online behavior. 

Now, my research explores the dynamics of online text, viewing it as both information and action.
