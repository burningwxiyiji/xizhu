☀️ Hello, Welcome to my page!

I'm a master's student at [East China University of Science and Technology](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/) specializing in sociology. I am a self-motivated student with a passion for digital sociology and computational social science.


Research Interests
======
*affective polarization, online hostility, digital activism, social contagion, sociology of knowledge, gender*

My research examines the complex impacts of hate speech and affective polarization on social media, focusing on their effects on public knowledge, particularly regarding gender issues. By conceptualizing online text as both opinion and action, I aim to explore how hostile discourse fosters collective identity, intensifies polarization, and influences societal norms.

I have already written a theoretical paper on the relationship between online collective action and the self (presented at The 9th Lilin Forum, CASS), as well as a study on digital vigilantism in China's online sphere.

Currently, I am using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) simulations to validate my theoretical explanations collaborating with [FangYiKuang Ding](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zZtzLEEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AILGF5VfcWBlFxNDWbP35F-rxUwbniY918HvT8HKCT7EnftWJwJU1SiARyLcTL0epdyZRdbv9B0FwlRSfjN1gSwjGuOIcN_-WFpdjkDUadnPwsPFPPOEUmelq9Gf-e9fiqEmpt8ZjSwkXAQotnDTXHcwrxU6HknWd97UAA7B8GBrmKha12sMhIq9pl8). Simulation helps bridge the gap between micro and macro research perspectives. I am also interested in exploring the use of LLM in social simulation.


Current Works
======

Theoretical Exploration of Dynamics of Online Collective Action
------

This paper argues that social media has enabled a deviation between action and the formation of identity. In digital action, the degree of self-integration of actors takes on an indeterminate character, which in turn explains the form of online collective action, thus providing an explanatory framework for online polarization and uncivil behaviors.

This article first constructs the concepts and theoretical hypotheses, proposing mechanisms that my collaborator formalizes mathematically. Finally, we use agent-based modeling (ABM) and real-case data from networks for validation and calibration.

This work can be referenced in the [draft](files/writing sample.pdf).


Empirical Research of Online Collective Action in Process
------

I am particularly interested in feminist movements online and the polarization of gender discourse. Therefore, I first conducted a case study on the recent trend of gender antagonism online. Regarding self-identity and the evolution of actions on the internet, digital activism and digital nationalism have both been extensively discussed. 

**Trolls and Polarization: Gender Antagonism on social media**

This study aims to analyze how these communities, each with distinct gender norms, use unique discourse strategies when interacting with outsiders. It provides an alternative perspective on gender culture in everyday contexts, rather than through serious political issues that evoke a strong sense of gender identity.


**Online Hate Speech and The Formation of Group Identity**

My research aims to explore the production of hate speech in online communities of marginalized or self-identified vulnerable groups, examining why and how individuals form new group identities when these identities give rise to in-group aggression, and whether or not they result in out-group hostility. For example, the incels assume themselves as victims of feminism and construct misogyny discourse. I am interested in how discursive strategies (e.g., memes or non-serious rhetoric) shape the political perceptions of these groups.

To address these questions, I aim to use a research framework that integrates cultural sociology with inferential network analysis(Cranmer, Desmarais, & Morgan, 2020) to investigate the interplay between identity-role interactions among community members and the resulting discursive effects, such as the emergence of hate speech within subcultures.


Other
------

**Unstructured Actions in Social Media: Understanding the Human Actor Within Digital Activism**

In the absence of other social organizations, the widespread dissemination of particular online discourses and the lack of political influence is virtually isomorphic. This article aims to unravel this isomorphism by revisiting the relationship between the individual and digital action, especially textual actions such as tweets.


Academic Journey
======

In my early research, I concentrated on the impact of ICT and software as infrastructure on daily life and government governance, primarily adopting perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS). This involved examining the tensions and changing relationships between technology and everyday life.

To bridge the relationship between micro-level interactions and macro-level societal consequences, I explored Computational Social Science (CSS) methods and began writing theoretical articles on the changing nature of subjects within internet interactions, delving into digital activism. Driven by an interest in the nature of media itself, I also engaged in projects related to algorithm design and participated in research on internet platforms and platform labor.

Methodology
------

Methodologically, I lean toward both quantitative and qualitative approaches. My research is problem-oriented and has a strong theoretical preference.

In my initial studies, I predominantly used qualitative and mixed research methods. During my undergraduate studies, I learned case study methods(2021), field research techniques(2021), and quantitative research using SPSS(2021).

My learning journey includes traditional quantitative research methods(survey, content analysis and experiment)(2021), quatitative social science(2022), social statistics(2022).

To analyze social media actors and bridge the gap between micro and macro research perspectives, I developed a strong interest in computational social science in my subsequent research. I have started to learn R programming(2023), intro to computational social science(2023), agent-based modeling(2023), python(2024) and social network analysis(2024)…

Hobbies
======

Poem. I’ve published some of them on WeChat. [For example](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NYfBgVDHK5eekF1ruojqxw). I ran a poetry club for youth through this account.

Writing and Reading. I've tried to create some [multimedia content](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4Rh4jz_zZBbla7NxmFHWoA).

Painting.

Music. I like post-punk, glitch, and techno.
